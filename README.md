A Personal Journey into Ecommerce
While our team shared a common interest in ecommerce, my personal journey into this project has a unique story. Growing up in a small middle-of-America town surrounded by farms and forests, I often relied on my bicycle to connect with friends in neighboring towns. Those early morning rides, with cornfields on both sides and the sun rising on the left, hold a special place in my heart. Cycling through the city now brings back those cherished memories, and I believe that everyone, especially city dwellers, should experience the joy that bicycling can bring to their lives. This personal connection with bicycles and the desire to make cycling more accessible fueled my passion for contributing to the ProShop project.
